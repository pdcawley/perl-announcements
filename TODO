* Think about making when_send the private interface and doing:

    $announcer->when(AnnouncementClass)->send(method => $target);
  
  or possibly

    $announcer->when(AnnouncementClass)->send('method')->to($target);

  leaning towards the former, as, if nothing else, it's shorter and doesn't require 
  the method name to be quoted.

Announcement version 0.0.1

Danger, Will Robinson. This is very much alpha quality. Right now it passes
its tests, but doesn't actually do anything. And even to pass its tests it
needs dependencies that aren't really properly covered in Makefile.PL. In
particular, you'll need to install rafl's gitub versions of:

parse-method-signatures  - git://github.com/rafl/parse-method-signatures.git
moosex-method-signatures - git://github.com/rafl/moosex-methods-signatures.git

If you think of this package as a five finger exercise by someone relearning
in public, you won't go far wrong.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


DEPENDENCIES

See above, but also

MooseX::Declare
Test::Class
